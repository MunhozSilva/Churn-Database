# Motivation
Database to study a pattern of clients that close their account on a bank

# Pre-processing
To give a better database to a machine learn algorithm, the data of this dataset has been modified with a technique called Undersampling.
It reduces the amount of data that could induce an algorithm to a binary decision of choosing that all elements are right or all elements are wrong.
To avoid this mislead, the data has been balanced in equal numbers of customers with Exited "true" and "false".
